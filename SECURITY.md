# Security Policy

This project follows a responsible vulnerability management process aligned with **ISO/IEC 27001** principles, including:
- Information security incident management
- Technical vulnerability management
- Secure communications and coordinated disclosure

## Supported Versions

Security updates are provided **only** for the versions listed below.

| Version | Supported |
| ------- | --------- |
| 5.1.x   | ✅ Supported |
| 5.0.x   | ❌ Not supported |
| 4.0.x   | ✅ Supported |
| < 4.0   | ❌ Not supported |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously and appreciate responsible disclosure.

### Where to Report

Please report vulnerabilities **privately** using one of these channels:

- **GitHub Security Advisories (preferred)**  
  Use the **“Report a vulnerability”** button in this repository.
- **Email:** `security@yourdomain.com`

-  **Do not report security issues via public GitHub issues, pull requests, or discussions.**

---

### What to Include

To help us investigate and respond efficiently, please include:

- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Affected component(s) and version(s)
- Steps to reproduce
- Proof-of-concept (if available)
- Potential impact on **confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA)**

---
 **Do not report security issues via public GitHub issues, pull requests, or discussions.**

## Vulnerability Handling Process

Our process reflects ISO/IEC 27001-aligned practices for triage, remediation, and controlled communication.

### Acknowledgement & Assessment

- **Acknowledgement:** within **72 hours**
- **Initial assessment:** within **5 business days**
- **Status updates:** at least every **14 days** until resolved (for accepted reports)

Assessment considers:
- Severity and impact
- Likelihood of exploitation
- Affected supported versions
- Availability of mitigations/workarounds

---

## Coordinated Disclosure

We ask reporters to avoid public disclosure until:

- A fix is released, **or**
- A mutually agreed disclosure timeline has passed

This helps protect users by allowing time to apply mitigations and updates.

---

## Resolution & Advisories

If a report is **accepted**, we will:
- Develop and test a fix for supported versions
- Release a patch and/or mitigation guidance
- Publish a **GitHub Security Advisory** when appropriate
- Credit the reporter (unless anonymity is requested)

If a report is **declined**, we will:
- Explain why (e.g., not reproducible, not a security issue, out of scope, unsupported version)

## Safe Harbor

We support good-faith security research. We will not pursue legal action against researchers who:

- Follow this policy and report vulnerabilities privately
- Avoid privacy violations, data destruction, and service disruption
- Do not exploit vulnerabilities beyond proof-of-concept
- Do not use social engineering, physical intrusion, or denial-of-service attacks

This safe harbor applies only to activities conducted in compliance with this policy.

---

## Security Updates

Security fixes may be delivered as:
- Patch releases
- Security advisories
- Mitigation guidance (when immediate fixes are not possible)

Users are responsible for applying updates promptly.
